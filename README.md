# Strategy <a name="sratergy-plane"></a>

## Research
###What are the most important aspects to a recipe website?

"I would like to navigate with a user-friendy interface and find your favourite recipes"
"I would like to find a food recipe that doesnt have to make me scroll through unnecessary content to find it"
"I would like a simple step by step guide of how to cook my desired dish"

### Competitor Review
[Delicios Magazine](https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/) - To much content on one page, messy interface, difficult to navigate <br>
[Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/) - Background story of recipes resulting in unnecessary scrolling and potentially lead the user astray <br>
[Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/) - Littered with advertisments resulting in bad UX <br>

### Wireframes

During the development process chnages have been made. All wireframes are the core skeleton to aid in the planning process and are not the final look of the design. I recommend that the PNGs are downloaded to be viewed in your own browser.

# Surface Plane <a name="surface-plane"></a>

## Brand Image
The brand Image/logo for "Simply Scrans" had to be simple, easy on the eye and co-ordinate with the overall theme. It is located at the head of the page and when engaged navigates the user back to the home section.

## Colour Schemes

The projects design is to remain consistant throughout, the aim was to implement a soft palette and eye catching for the user. 
This was designed with the main font [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) and styled with CSS



<img src="static/img/colour-palette.png">

All colour choices where assesed within the guidelines of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). Each colour was used with [Contrast Ratio](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%23212121-on-%23F0F3F4) and graded within the guidelines of [W3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) .

#### Green/Cyan (#2D936C)
This is the most important choice of colour which I have implemented throughout the design. 
Green symbolises fresh produce which matches with the projects main purpose.   
<img src="static/img/w3-2.png">
#### Charcoal (#454851)
Charcoal replaced the colour black as its more soft on the eye and gives a modern/professional feel.
<img src="static/img/w3-1.png">
#### Cultured (#F0F3F5)
An off white background helps soften the users visual experience and adds visual emphasis to other important parts of the design

#### Copper Crayola (#E88D67)
Unfortunately I had to remove this colour from any form of text, as it fails the W3 on a Cultured (#F03FD) background.
I managed to implement it on the social links hover rule to add a robust feel when the user engages.  
## Typography 

[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) font was used for a well balanced look and professional look, font weight of 200 used on small text and bold used on the titles for a stand out look. 

## Images

The Five images used where from free to use sources imagery from [Google](https://www.google.com/). All images will be credited in the credits section below.

## Visual Interactions
### navbar
The navbar is the main method of navigating throughout the site and is a key role in aiding in strong UX.
Each navigational link when idle remains Charcoal (#454851) unless initiated by user, when this happens the state of the navagtional link changes to Green/Cyan (#2D936C).
this helps aids in functionality and remain intuitive.

### Call To Action Buttons
Point of contact needs to be appealing and interactive. for the main C2A points I went in too great detail of styling which provides the user with a visual appearance.
As C2A points a are important in providing a good UX, I kept the consistant feel of freshness. When ideal the C2A remain clear with a cyan border until the user initates there met by a swooping Green/Cyan effect
to help draw the user in.
