# Strategy <a name="sratergy-plane"></a>

## Research
###What are the most important aspects to a recipe website?

"I would like to navigate with a user-friendy interface and find my favourite recipes"
"I would like to find a food recipe that doesnt have to make me scroll through unnecessary content to find it"
"I would like a simple step by step guide of how to cook my desired dish"

### Competitor Review
[Delicios Magazine](https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/) - To much content on one page, messy interface, difficult to navigate <br>
[Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/) - Background story of recipes resulting in unnecessary scrolling and potentially lead the user astray <br>
[Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/) - Littered with advertisments resulting in bad UX <br>
