## Research
### What are the most important aspects of a recipe website?

"I would like to navigate with a user-friendly interface and find your favourite recipes"
"I would like to find a food recipe that doesn't have to make me scroll through unnecessary content to find it"
"I would like a simple step by step guide of how to cook my desired dish"

### Competitor Review
[Delicios Magazine](https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/) - To much content on one page, messy interface, difficult to navigate <br>
[Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/) - Background story of recipes resulting in unnecessary scrolling and potentially lead the user astray <br>
[Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/) - Littered with advertisments resulting in bad UX <br>

### Wireframes

During the development process, changes have been made. All wireframes are the core skeleton to aid in the planning process and are not the final look of the design. I recommend that the PNGs are downloaded to be viewed in your browser.

# Surface Plane <a name="surface-plane"></a>

## Brand Image
The brand image/logo for "Simply Scrans" had to be simple, easy on the eye and coordinate with the overall theme. It is located at the head of the page and when engaged navigates the user back to the home section.
<img src="static/img/readme-img/logo.png">



## Colour Schemes

The project's design is to remain consistent throughout, the aim was to implement a soft palette and eye catching for the user. 
This was designed with the main font [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) and styled with CSS



<img src="static/img/readme-img/colour-palette.png">

All colour choices were assessed within the guidelines of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). Each colour was used with [Contrast Ratio](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%23212121-on-%23F0F3F4) and graded within the guidelines of [W3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) .

#### Green/Cyan (#2D936C)
This is the most important choice of colour which I have implemented throughout the design. 
Green symbolises fresh produce which matches the projects main purpose.   
<img src="static/img/readme-img/w3-2.png">
#### Charcoal (#454851)
Charcoal replaced the colour black as its more soft on the eye and gives a modern/professional feel.
<img src="static/img/readme-img/w3-1.png">
#### Cultured (#F0F3F5)
An off white background helps soften the user's visual experience and adds visual emphasis to other important parts of the design

#### Copper Crayola (#E88D67)
Unfortunately, I had to remove this colour from any form of text, as it fails the W3 on a Cultured (#F03FD) background.
I managed to implement it on the social links hover rule to add a robust feel when the user engages.  
## Typography 

[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) font was used for a well-balanced look and professional look, font-weight of 200 used on small text with bold used on the titles for a stand outlook. 

## Images

The Five images used were from free to use sources imagery from [Google](https://www.google.com/). All images will be credited in the credits section below.

## Visual Interactions
### navbar
The navbar is the main method of navigating throughout the site and is a key role in aiding in strong UX.
Each navigational link when idle remains Charcoal (#454851) unless initiated by the user, when this happens the state of the navigational link changes to Green/Cyan (#2D936C).
this helps aids in functionality and remain intuitive. 

<img src="static/img/readme-img/nav-bar.png">

### Call To Action Buttons
The point of contact needs to be appealing and interactive. for the main C2A points, I went into great detail about styling which provides the user with a visual appearance.
As C2A points are important in providing a good UX, I kept the consistent feel of freshness. When ideal the C2A remain clear with a cyan border until the user initiates there met by a swooping Green/Cyan effect
to help draw the user in.

# Features <a name="features"></a>


## Existing Features

### Retrieving Goole API 
The main feature in my webpage is extracting data from [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) and incorporating it into clickable buttons to make the user interact with the map.
On each click of a button, markers will drop on the map, and then the markers themselves once clicked will open an info window. 
The info windows contain information on each location such as the name and address of the placed marker. The info windows contain details of opening hours, menus that are linked to an external source and contact number.

### Navigation Effects
Navigation plays a key role in user experience, implementing visually pleasing effects makes the website more dynamic and interactive.
Adding the feature [Scroll Reveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/) which is a JavaScript library for easily animating elements as they enter/leave the viewport. Java script has also been used to change the colour state of the navbar links when interacted with, this is to allow the user to understand what section of the webpage they are in.


### Contact 
This is a place to connect the user and the admin. I designed this feature in a modal for not navigating the user away from the main page.
When the contact button is initiated you are presented with a modal containing a form with five inputs to be interacted with. The functionality of the form is connected with [Emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/).
 
### Favicon Iconfinder

My favicon is an image of an avocado to symbolise freshness. The image is situated in the tab, this helps the webpage stand out if the user's address bar is cluttered.

### Modals

Modals are implemented into the site, using Bootstrap, to provide an additional degree of interactivity. Modals avoid the need to use window pop-ups or page reloads
and keep the user's usability on the site. The models contain the method and ingredients in a simplistic eye-catching design.

### Responsive Design

This project is designed to be fully compatible and interactive on all screen types and sizes, ensuring maximum functionality down to 280px width screen sizes.
All features implemented have been adjusted to a size where necessary in the `stylesheet.css` using `@media`. This allows you to not only vary viewport dimensions based on screen size but also allows me to set different style properties for different devices.

## Features To Implement

### Food Search Engine

Extract data from a recipe API engine to allow the user to be able to search, Save and organize recipes.

### Registration And Log In 

Implement signup and login page to allow users to access their saved recipes at any given time, this feature will need an open-source data base [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

### Social Platform 

Allow users to interact with each other by comparing recipes, cooking techniques and stories. This can be implemented using HTML,CSS and javascript.
